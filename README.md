## Steno Display Font Demo

Feel free to download any of the fonts on the repo!

- Stenodisplay-Dict: Used for browsing Plover dictionaries.

## Deprecated Stuff

These fonts are used for the tape, but it's highly recommended that you use the [Layout Display](https://pypi.org/project/plover-layout-display/) plugin instead. Make sure you install TapeSteno first, then TapeBase. Installing TapeBase will allow you to use TapeSteno in Plover's tape function despite it not being a monospaced font.

- Stenodisplay-TapeBase: Used for Plover Tape (only tested on Windows)
- Stenodisplay-TapeSteno: Used for Plover Tape (only tested on Windows)


## Future Plans

Currently busy with life but once I'm free I'll be doing an overhaul of the fonts to include more labelled stuff. Stay tuned! (No guarantees tho)
