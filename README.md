## Features

### Layouts

Stenodisplay comes with four layouts in the latest release package: 
- **Classic**, where most keys are the same width;
- **Wide**, with a wide asterisk key as well as wide D and Z keys;
- **Square**, where all keys are square or rectangular;
- **Palantype**, which is an alternative stenographic layout used sometimes in the UK.

On the palantype layout, both cross (`+`) and point (`^`) are assigned to two keys - if you'd like to highlight just one key, you may use `[]` and `<>` respectively.

### Variants

In addition to different layouts, each layout comes with different variants with varying label text size, suitable for different applications such as large label texts for inline diagrams, or small labels for large diagrams between paragraphs. Note that these variants are not available for the Palantype layout yet.
